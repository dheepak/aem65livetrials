# SPA Page Component

We will be creating a fully functional page component in two steps.

Step 1. [Page Component](PageComponent.md)
This page component will the show react app and its content on an AEM page. Content editing would not be possible at this step.

Step 2. [Editable Page Component](EditablePageComponent.md) 
Editable Page comonent will enable content authoring and the addition of components in AEM. It will fetch content from AEM Repository and React will render the content on AEM page.
